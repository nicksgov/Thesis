Hello to all

This is my thesis. It includes an abstract at the beginning, followed by instructions on how to find the code and data used for the analysis."

Abstract

A general problem, which is certainly linked to the emergence of new technologies, is the inadequacy of data for the training of machine learning algorithms, with the use of which we are asked to make predictions and analyses. Thus, in the distribution networks, a large amount of data is required for the supervision, as well as the orderly operation of the electrical networks. Especially in recent years, with the inclusion of new loads such as electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage units, it was inevitable to expand networks, renew and upgrade them. As a result, in many cases the data we have to manage is insufficient, or even the minimal network load data we have, remains available to a few because of the confidentiality code.
We are called to solve this problem in this thesis. Using machine learning algorithms and other statistical approaches, we strive to achieve more data acquisition through synthetic generation. In the present work, the proposed technique was implemented in a PyCharm environment using 'Python' programming language and applied to generate one-time synthetic data of both active and reactive power for 3 different buses. A key concern is to maintain the same correlation of the load data of the different buses with each other, initially and finally. Finally, the data is checked for suitability by comparing some statistical metrics and through a power flow analysis.
